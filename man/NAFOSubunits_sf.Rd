\item{OBJECTID}{ESRI ArcMap Field}
\item{Shape_Leng}{ESRI ArcMap Field}
\item{Shape_Area}{ESRI ArcMap Field}
\item{NAFO_1}{NAFO area (coarse) - this is the numerical identifier plus a
single letter code (e.g. "4V")}
\item{NAFO_2}{NAFO area (medium) - this is the numerical identifier plus two
letters - if available (e.g. "4VS")}
\item{NAFO_3}{NAFO area (finest) - this is the numerical identifier plus three
letters - if available (e.g. "4VSB")}
\item{NAFO_BEST}{This is the highest resolution descriptor for any given
polygon.  For some areas, this will have 3 letters (e.g. "4VSB"), but for
others, it might have only a single letter code (e.g. "6F")}
\item{COD}{The Cod assessment unit uses groups of NAFO areas to group the data
(e.g. "4VN", "4VsW" and "4X") .  This field hold those categories.
}
\item{COD_BEST}{This is the highest resolution descriptor for any given
cod area.  It is different from "COD" in that 4XP is broken into 4X_SS (Scotian
Shelf) and 4X _BoF (Bay of Fundy), as per direction from that unit.}

\description{
These are the divisions and subdivisions for the NAFO regulatory areas.  The
divisions can be downloaded from https://www.nafo.int/Data/GIS. The subdivisions
are originally derived from the 1995 Canadian Hydrographic Service Chart 10040 -
"Fisheries and Oceans Statistical Chart" - "Gulf of Maine to Strait of Belle Isle".
